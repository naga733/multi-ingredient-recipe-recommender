This project presents a Personalized Recipe Recommendation System that 
seamlessly integrates multi-ingredient detection using advanced object 
detection algorithms and personalized recipe retrieval. The core innovation lies 
in leveraging YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to identify 
multiple food ingredients from a single image with high precision. The detected 
ingredients serve as input to a dynamic recipe recommendation module, which 
retrieves tailored recipes through the Spoonacular API, considering user 
preferences such as cuisine type, dietary restrictions, and intolerances. 

The system has been implemented as an interactive web application, allowing 
users to: 
• Upload images of available ingredients. 
• Specify dietary and culinary preferences. 
• Retrieve personalized recipe suggestions displayed in an intuitive, user
friendly interface. 

This solution addresses critical challenges in food technology, including 
reducing food wastage by suggesting recipes based on ingredients nearing 
expiration and promoting healthier dietary habits through personalization. 
The project emphasizes the practical applications of artificial intelligence in 
everyday scenarios, demonstrating how advanced detection models like YOLO 
can be combined with API-based services to create impactful solutions. 

The results showcase the efficiency of YOLOv11 in multi-ingredient detection 
and the Spoonacular API in recipe customization, proving this system's 
potential to transform ingredient-based meal planning for diverse user needs. 
Future extensions may include expanding ingredient classes, integrating IoT
enabled smart kitchen devices, and incorporating autonomous recipe 
generation models for enhanced functionality
