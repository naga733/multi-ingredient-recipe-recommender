# Personalized Recipe Recommendation System with Multi-Ingredient Detection using YOLO

**NextMeal** is a web app that recommends recipes based on what's in your kitchen. It uses YOLOv11, a modern object detection model, to identify multiple ingredients from a single image. Once it knows what foods are in the image, it sends that list to a recommendation system that pulls matching recipes from the Soonacular API. The app also takes into account personal preferences like cuisine type, dietary restrictions, and food intolerances to make the suggestions more relevant.

The system has been implemented as an interactive web application, allowing 
users to: 

- Upload images of available ingredients. 

- Specify dietary and culinary preferences.
  
- Manually include and exclude certain ingredients, specify meal types.

- Retrieve personalized recipe suggestions displayed in an intuitive, user
friendly interface.

## Impact

This project addresses critical challenges in food technology, including:  
- **Reducing food wastage** by suggesting recipes for ingredients nearing expiration.  
- **Promoting healthier dietary habits** through personalization.  

It also demonstrates the practical applications of **artificial intelligence in everyday life**, showcasing how advanced detection models like YOLO can be integrated with API-driven services to create impactful solutions.
